<h2> Features </h2>

<h3> Groups </h3>

<p> You can use the group feature to keep track of bills and owed money between multiple people.
  Creating a group is simple, you need to use the create group function and add as many people as you want using the email address they use to login to RePay. </p>
<p> Once a group has been created you can; add more people, remove people and add bills. To upload receipts press the upload receipt button and then select the image of the
  receipt from your device. Once uploaded everyone in the group can see the receipt and work out how much is owed by each of them. </p>

<h3> Account Types </h3>
<p> When logging in you can either use an existing google account, or create a new account with us (known as a RePay account).</p> <p2> We securely store all of the encrypted password and emails.</p2> <p> These accounts function exactly the same so feel free to use whichever works best for you! </p>
